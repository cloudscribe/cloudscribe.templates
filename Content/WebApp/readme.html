                            It is always a good idea to use the latest cloudscribe NuGet packages.
                            Right click the solution node and choose "Manage NuGet Packages for Solution", then check for any available updates.

                        <strong>Set your MySql Connection string.</strong> -
                        You should copy the connection string from appsettings.json into appsettings.Development.json and set it to a valid connection string
						for MySql using the format shown in appsettings.json. If your project is under source control such as git, you should add the 
						appsettings.Development.json file to your .gitignore file so it won't be committed to source control.

                        You should copy the connection string from appsettings.json into appsettings.Development.json and set it to a valid connection string
						for PostgreSql using the format shown in appsettings.json. If your project is under source control such as git, you should add the

                         <strong>Be aware of potential long file name errors on windows.</strong> 
                        You chose NoDb file system storage for data storage. There is a known issue on windows that may potentially impact you. Just keep this in mind
                        if you encounter any "path too long" exceptions.  Since NoDb uses long guids for file names and also for some folder names it can result in long file paths that may exceed the 255 character
                        file path limit on windows. The best way to avoid that problem is to use a short folder path such as c:\c\yourprojectname, if you use a very deep 
                        nested path you may encounter errors.
                    </li>

                        <strong>Login Credentials</strong> 
                        When you first run the project application an administrative user account will be created automatically with the email admin@admin.com 
                        and the password admin. Once you login with administrative permissions a new Administration menu will appear, you should take a look around 
                        the various menu items to find the configurable settings that are of interest to you. One of the first things you should do is change the email
                        address and password of the admin user account.  You can change the email under Administration > User Management > User List.
						You can change the password by clicking the welcome user message at the top of the page. Be careful not to forget your password at least until
						you have configured SMTP settings for email because password reset emails can't be sent until you do that.
                        If you deploy the application to public facing web hosting be sure to change these credentials immediately after deployment.

                        <strong>Data Protection</strong> 
                        Be sure to see the comments in Startup.cs about data protection and how to configure the storage location of data protection keys.
                        Data protection keys are used to encrypt some settings that are persisted to data storage such as the password for SMTP, and the "secrets" 
                        for social authentication.

                         In order for certain features like password reset or requiring a confirmed email to work, your site needs to be able to send email notifications.
                         You will find settings for this under Administration > Email Settings
                    </li>

                        In addition to the email settings mentioned above, since you have included cloudscribe SimpleContactForm, you also need to configure SMTP
                        settings in the appsettings.config file, as well as an email address to receive the contact form submissions. Be sure to test the contact form after your site is online
                        to verify that the settings are correct.

                        Since you included the Custom Registration with key/value storage feature, we have included the file app-userproperties.json 
                        which has some sample custom registration fields to get you started. You will want to change those to match the needs of your project.
                        See the <a href="https://www.cloudscribe.com/docs/configuration-based-custom-registration-and-user-properties?utm_source=projecttemplate&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=newproject-UTM-CAMPAIGN">Custom Registration Documentation</a>

                        You included the IdentityServer4 integration. Use of IdentityServer4 is a complex topic, you should mainly consult their 
                        <a href="http://docs.identityserver.io/en/release/">documentation</a>, but you can also find a working example with 2 tenants
                        and 2 clients (one per tenant), in our <a href="https://github.com/joeaudette/cloudscribe.StarterKits/tree/master/cloudscribe-idserver-nodb">Starter Kits Repository</a>.
                        By comparing your setup with that working sample, you should be able to figure out how to configure things for your needs.

                        <strong>Build your own custom features</strong> 
                        Now that your project is created, you likely have plans to write some code for the custom features you need. cloudscribe doesn't impose 
                        any prescriptive requirements or patterns for how you build your own features, you can typically use any patterns and approaches
                        that you would normally use in ASP.NET Core. But there is some guidance provided for getting the current user information and how to
                        optionally implement multi-tenancy in your own features if you need that.
                        See the <a href="https://www.cloudscribe.com/docs/building-custom-features-that-integrate-with-cloudscribe-core?utm_source=projecttemplate&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=newproject-UTM-CAMPAIGN">Building Custom Features Documentation</a>

                        <strong>Advanced Client Side Development with Webpack</strong> -
                        You included the optional webpack setup in your project, well done, a bold choice! 
                        I use this setup myself for pretty much all of my client projects because I almost always need a custom bootstrap theme for 
                        my client projects and I like to use bootstrap-sass. When you run your project, the site will be all setup to use a custom theme named custom1
                        that is already wired up to use bootstrap-sass so it is ready to customize easily. You will want to customize the sass files under app-scss, and 
                        the _Layout.cshtml file under sitefiles/s1/themes/custom1/Shared. For example look in the _variables.scss file for $navbar-inverse-bg:  
                        which controls the background color of the top navigation. Change the color and refresh the page and it should change right away because
                        we are using webpack hot module loading.
                        Since the generated css and js bundles land in wwwroot/dist folder, it is best to exclude that folder
                        in your .gitignore file if you are using git.
                        Please see the documentation to learn about the tooling prerequisites and the benefits and features of this setup at <a href="https://www.cloudscribe.com/docs/advanced-client-side-development-with-webpack?utm_source=projecttemplate&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=newproject-UTM-CAMPAIGN">https://www.cloudscribe.com/docs/advanced-client-side-development-with-webpack</a>.

                        <strong>Create a Custom theme</strong> 
                        There are a bunch of bootswatch themes included and you can choose the theme from a dropdown list under Administration > Site Settings after you login to your project.
                        But more than likely you will want to create a custom theme.
                        See the <a href="https://www.cloudscribe.com/docs/themes-and-web-design?utm_source=projecttemplate&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=newproject-UTM-CAMPAIGN">Themes and Web Design</a>

                        <strong>Configuration Sources</strong> 
                        By default, the configuration system will let you override appsettings.json from appsettings.Development.json when the environment is Development.
                        I would avoid putting any sensitive information directly in appsettings.json because you will likely want to include that file in source control.
                        You can copy any settings from appsettings.json into appsettings.Development.json instead of putting anything sensitive in appsettings.json.
                        I generally add appsettings.Development.json to my .gitignore file so that any connection strings or credentials I put there won't go into source control.
                        It also supports overriding appsettings.json with appsettings.Production.json if the environment is Production. We don't include an
                        appsettings.Production.json file in the template, I usually would create that file manually on the production server as part of my first deployment.
                        For Azure hosting you would generally use Environment Variables or Azure Key Vault as discussed in the 
                        <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/configuration?tabs=basicconfiguration">official documentation</a>.

                        There is also tracking of account activities such as site registration and logins, including social login tracking.
